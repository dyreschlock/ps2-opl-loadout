# Personal PS2 OPL Configuration

This repository houses the interface I use for OPL on my Playstation 2. I use Jonepo's very simple and clean Theme, Blur. The original can be found <a href="https://www.psx-place.com/threads/opl-theme-n-glass-remix-supports-all-opl.43565/">here</a>. I have made a few changes to suit the information I want to display.

Also included are all the CFG and ART files for all of the games on my Playstation 2.
